# osci

## todo

- custom/togglable glissando
- matching perceived volumes across wave types
- pitch bend
- esc: panic mute
- space: add octave down?
- fade to fix sine clip

## bugs

- monophonic shifted octave's return
- monophonic wave type

## meh

- poly gliss  from closest stillPressed instead of lastPressed

## refactoring

- keys event handling
- more succinct bound functions
- flesh out key constants
    - rows should be in view
        - can eventWhich be determined programatically?
- poly gliss timeOut stuff is weak...

## whoa

- corrigan
